                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>I began working with the Sommelier Society of America in 2014 to help them build their new website. It was a basic Wordpress site, and it suited them well for that point in time. Since then, they have grown rapidly and have begun branching out and offering different types of courses. As a result, I teamed up with Systematic to begin work on a more robust system. We were first contracted to develop the Alumni Network, a small, invite-only network that allowed SSA alumni to communicate with each other.</p>
                
                <p>One of the major challenges we had to overcome was how to easily accept payments online. With the Wordpress site, the course registration form was generated from a plugin that simply directed users to a payment page on PayPal. This worked for a time, but as SSA grew, certain issues came to light and it was clear that we needed a different system. We instead created a new course registration page outside of Wordpress that integrated with Stripe, allowing users to register and pay all on one page. This drastically simplified things for the site owners as they were able to manage, delete, and export all registrations from a unified management system that we created.</p>

                <p>
                    We are currently working with SSA on a complete overhaul of their existing website.
