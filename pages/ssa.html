                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>From 2015-2016, I was the developer of Ghost, a Destiny companion app. My goal was to create a beautifully designed app while improving a user's gaming experience.</p>
                
                <p>My challenge was that there were already several Destiny companion apps available, so I needed something to make my app stand out. To do this, I implemented two features, "Tracked" and "Near Me". The first allows a user to have a push notification sent to their phone when a public event (an in-game, cooperative activity) is about to start. The second feature allows users to have the app track where they are in-game, and receive listings of public events based upon their location.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Since this was a hybrid app, a major emphasis was placed on performance. This app boasts 60fps animations and smooth scrolling, two things that are not often found in hybrid applications. I utilized the Ionic Framework to accomplish my goal of creating a fast and easy to use hybrid app. It was my first attempt at creating an application, so there was a significant learning curve that I had to overcome before I shipped the app in January of 2016.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Due to longer term work goals, I was forced to discontinue development of Ghost Companion during Summer 2016.
