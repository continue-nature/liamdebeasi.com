                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>During the Summer of 2015, I worked with Systematic, LLC. to build a new website for Angeles Investment Advisors, an advisory firm based in Santa Monica, CA. I was responsible for developing both front-end and back-end components for the site.</p>

                <p>Since this was a larger scale website, site performance was taken into consideration so the site's code could be optimized. The server had to accommodate large amounts of traffic, and as such the website had to accommodate all of the data associated with that traffic as well. Using the Django Framework, I assisted other Systematic team members in build a high performance, scalable website.</p>
                
                <p>I am currently working on site maintenance, bug fixes, and adding new front-end functionality to the website.</p>
